              <h2>N95 Respirators</h2>
              <p>
                <b>The N95 mask</b> is a form of respiratory protective wear
                worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of
                inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is
                a disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in
                a highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this
                process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms
                the filtration layer capable of filtering out at
                <b>least 95%</b> of airborne particles when worn correctly.
                <br /><br />
                During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
                intense air pollution, wearing <b>N95 masks</b> has been shown
                to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out
                nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate
                existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
                respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy
                and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility
                can particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are
                out in public and unable to control the breathing environments
                that they find themselves in.

              <h2>N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings</h2>
              <p class="discr-text">
                Most <b>N95 respirators</b> are manufactured for use in
                construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers
                to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National
                Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the
                National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
                which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                (CDC). <br /><br />
                However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health
                care setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory
                protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during
                procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel
                from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and
                particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class
                II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC
                NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
